# Check which python you use
`which python`

if you have
`/usr/bin/python`
then you must activate the virtual environment
`$ source ./venv/bin/activate`

if you have something similar to 
`/home/yona/work/tcom/tcp/venv/bin/python`
with `/home/yona/work/tcom/` replaced by your own path then your virtualenv is activated !

# Launch server
`sudo python demo_server.py`

# Launch client
`sudo python demo_client.py`
